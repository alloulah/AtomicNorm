# AtomicNorm

This repo contains a vanilla Matlab implementation of 1-dimensional spectal estimation via Atomic Norm. Based on original work by [Bhaskar et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1204.0562) and extension for multi-measurement snapshots by [Li and Chi](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1408.2242).

Installation of convex optimisation toolbox [CVX](http://cvxr.com/cvx/) is assumed. Alternatively, run script `set_path` to use toolbox, assuming it is available in your workspace.
